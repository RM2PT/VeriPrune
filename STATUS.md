- Reasons
	- We release the full source code of everything that is necessary to re-produce every result of the paper. 
	- We release all of the neural networks used in our experiments, namely the ACAS Xu, MNIST, and HAR networks. We also release the tools we developed to produce the truncated networks, and the subtracted networks as described in the paper.
	- We provide scripts that demonstrate that how to execute VeriPrune. These scripts re-run some of the shorter-running experiments described in the paper.
	- We also release the full scripts used to run all of the experiments if anyone would like to reproduce all of our results.
